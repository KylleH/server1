1. Accessing Files in WSL
WSL allows you to access Windows files from the Linux environment. Here’s how it works:

Windows Drives in WSL: Windows drives (e.g., C:, D:) are mounted in WSL under /mnt/. For example:

C:\Users\kylle\Desktop\Web app\venv\cnn_classifier.keras can be accessed in WSL as:

Copy
/mnt/c/Users/kylle/Desktop/Web app/venv/cnn_classifier.keras
Flash Drive: If your model is on a flash drive (e.g., E:), it will be accessible as:

Copy
/mnt/e/path/to/cnn_classifier.keras
2. Using the Model in Your Application
To use the cnn_classifier.keras model in your FastAPI application, you need to ensure the correct path is provided in your code. Here’s how you can handle it:

Option 1: Use Absolute Path
If you want to keep the model file on your Windows file system, you can use the absolute path in your code. For example:

python
Copy
# Update the model path to use the WSL path
model_path = "/mnt/c/Users/kylle/Desktop/Web app/venv/cnn_classifier.keras"
model = load_model(model_path)
Option 2: Copy the Model to the Linux File System
If you prefer to keep the model within the Linux file system (e.g., inside your Git repository), you can copy it to your project directory.

Copy the Model:

Copy the model file from your Windows file system to your Git repository:

bash
Copy
cp /mnt/c/Users/kylle/Desktop/Web\ app/venv/cnn_classifier.keras /path/to/your-repo/models/
Update the Model Path:

Update the model_path in your code to use the relative path:

python
Copy
model_path = "models/cnn_classifier.keras"
model = load_model(model_path)
Add the Model to .gitignore:

Since the model file is large, you should add it to .gitignore to avoid uploading it to GitHub:

Copy
models/cnn_classifier.keras
3. Using the Model in Docker
If you’re running your application in a Docker container, you need to ensure the model file is available inside the container. Here’s how to handle it:

Option 1: Mount the Model File as a Volume
You can mount the model file from your Windows file system into the Docker container as a volume.

Update the Docker Run Command:

Use the -v flag to mount the model file:

bash
Copy
docker run -d -p 10000:10000 \
  -v /mnt/c/Users/kylle/Desktop/Web\ app/venv/cnn_classifier.keras:/app/models/cnn_classifier.keras \
  --name your-api-container your-api
Update the Model Path in Your Code:

Use the path inside the container:

python
Copy
model_path = "models/cnn_classifier.keras"
model = load_model(model_path)
Option 2: Copy the Model into the Docker Image
If you want the model to be part of the Docker image, you can copy it during the build process.

Copy the Model to Your Git Repository:

Copy the model file to your project directory (e.g., models/).

Update the Dockerfile:

Add a step to copy the model file into the image:

dockerfile
Copy
# Copy the model file
COPY models/cnn_classifier.keras /app/models/cnn_classifier.keras
Update the Model Path in Your Code:

Use the path inside the container:

python
Copy
model_path = "models/cnn_classifier.keras"
model = load_model(model_path)
Add the Model to .gitignore:

Add the model file to .gitignore to avoid uploading it to GitHub:

Copy
models/cnn_classifier.keras
4. Example Updated Code
Here’s how your code might look after updating the model path:

python
Copy
import os
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

# Define the model path (adjust based on your setup)
model_path = "/mnt/c/Users/kylle/Desktop/Web app/venv/cnn_classifier.keras"  # WSL path
# OR
# model_path = "models/cnn_classifier.keras"  # Relative path in Docker or Linux

# Load the CNN model
model = load_model(model_path)
5. Summary of Options
Option	Description
Absolute Path in WSL	Use the WSL path (/mnt/c/...) to access the model file directly.
Copy to Linux File System	Copy the model to your Git repository and use a relative path.
Mount as Volume in Docker	Mount the model file from your Windows file system into the Docker container.
